Sign-Language-Converter

Sign language is used by people who have speaking or listening disabilities so that they can
exchange information between other people and within their own community. This can be used
on a wide scale to make most of the public understand what a person is trying to convey to the
world through sign language. This will prevent disabled people from hiring other people who can
speak and understand sign language just to be their communicator.
Sign Language Converter is a machine learning program that detects and recognizes audio signals
received to text using speech to text API (python modules or Google API) and then making a visual
presentation (video) of the converted sign language which requires machine learning as a part.
Sign gestures can be majorly classified into two types, static and dynamic. The static gesture is
simpler than dynamic gesture recognition, in a static only a single image is recognized at a time
while on the other hand dynamic gesture is a moving gesture represented by various images.
Various signs performed by the hand and convert it into text/speech.
